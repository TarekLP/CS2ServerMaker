**CS2 Server Maker / Hoster**

**The Goal:**

The goal of this Program is simple, to allow regular people to host CS2 Servers for their friends, or maybe even for public use. The program is quite simple to use as the installation of CS2 and the search of your IP and Workshop subscribed Content is all automatically
done and setup, Game setup is also quite simple since its all just a list of Dropdowns or Textboxes. Theres even a built in console to more easily see Errors or send Commands.

**Plans:**

- Automatic Workshop subscription search (to host custom maps)
- A more refined UI
- More optimizations
